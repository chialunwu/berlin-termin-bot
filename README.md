## What is this?

This bot helps you book an appointment from https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen or https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/.

For booking a LEA appointment: Without using a bot, you have to fill out the form every 10 minutes and constantly click the 'Next' button. It's INHUMANE. Even if you get to the date selection page, you probably can't book an appointment because someone else is faster than you, so you end up having to repeat the process endlessly. It should be a crime for the people who invented this!
This bot automates the manual steps for you. You just need to fill out the initial form once and run the bot. When you hear the alert and notification, proceed with the remaining steps manually (selecting the time, solving the reCAPTCHA, and entering your name, birthday, and email), and end your nightmare.

For booking a Bürgeramt appointment: Although you don't need to fill the fxxking form first, you still need to refresh the page constantly, and if you refresh the page too frequently, you could get blocked for 1 hour. By using this bot, it'll refresh the page every 60 seconds for you.

## How to use?

### Get the bot

1. Download `berlin-termin-bot.zip`

   - [macOS (apple chip)](https://github.com/chialunwu/berlin-termin-bot/releases/download/v1.0.0/berlin-termin-bot_macosapple.zip)
   - [macOS (intel chip)](https://github.com/chialunwu/berlin-termin-bot/releases/download/v1.0.0/berlin-termin-bot_macosintel.zip)

2. Unzip the file
3. Right-click the program (`berlin-termin-bot`) and click 'Open' to run it (Don't double-click)

### Book a LEA appointment

1. Fill out the form and click `Start`
2. Wait for the alarm/notification
3. If you hear the alarm, rush to select the day and time and solve the reCAPTCHA. If the time dropdown is empty, it means it's gone. Go to the Terminal window and hit 'Enter' to start over.
4. Good luck!

#### Tips 💡

You'll most likely get an appointment during working hours when they release new slots. Outside of working hours, you might occasionally see available time slots when people cancel their appointments, but it's nearly impossible to secure one. If you run the bot from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, you should be able to get an appointment within 2-3 weeks. Cheer up!
